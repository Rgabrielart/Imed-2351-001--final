<div class="div5"> <p><span class="bolded">Comics </span> fans and historians split the history of comics into "ages", which are sequential periods of time that each have a shared feel reflective of the general trends in comics during the years that the "age" spans.
At ComicSpectrum we will also call out some key sub-divisions within ages (and sometimes spanning multiple ages).  Each has its own unique characteristics that are worth calling out and are worth examining and understanding.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it's useful to break up and understand the common sub-divisions in the history of comics for collecting purposes.  Many people like to specialize on collecting from one or multiple ages, or even concentrating on collecting within some of the specialized sub-divisions, like EC or Underground comics . </p>
<p> The Platinum Age applies to all comics that came out before the 1st appearance of Superman in 1938 and is a very specialized area of comics collecting.  The number of people collecting these comics is very small and less is known about them than comics from the Golden Age forward, but they undeniably laid the foundation that modern comics were built upon.  Popular character from the pre-super-hero days include R.F. Outcault's The Yellow Kid, George McManus' Bringing Up Father (with Jiggs & Maggie), and Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse.  </p>
<p>The Golden Age of comics is considered by most fans and comics scholars to have started with the first appearance of Superman in Action Comics #1 (June 1938) and ran through 1956.  Action Comics #1 changed the landscape of comic book from that point all they way to today.  Batman soon followed, debuting in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939) and then a host of other super-heroes who would ultimately form a team, The Justice Society of America, in All-Star Comics #3 (Winter 1940).   Super-Heroes became very popular and soon dominated the majority of the titles that were being produced.   DC Comics (known as National in the Golden Age) is often thought of first when people think of the Golden Age because of iconic characters like Batman and Superman.  </p>
<p> Timely Comics (that would eventually go on to become Atlas and finally Marvel Comics) burst onto the scene not long after the debut of Superman and Batman, offering up Marvel Comics #1 in October 1939, debuting the iconic characters of the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner.  Captain America joined them in March 1941 and the Golden Age had another strong stable of super-heroes for the young fans to buy.   </p>
<p>The third major contender in the Golden Age super-hero market was Fawcett Comics.  Their most iconic super-hero was Captain Marvel, debuting in WHIZ Comics #2 (Feb 1940).  Fawcett created a number of other heroes over the years, but none had the endurance of Captain Marvel and the "Marvel Family".  Their adventures dominated the comics at Fawcett, they would guest star in a number of other comics and even introduce new characters to the Fawcett fans.  There were certainly other publishers during the Golden Age, dozens, but the 3 spotlighted here created the most enduring super-hero characters.
By the early 1950s, with the exception of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, the Golden Age of Super-Heroes was over.  DC's "Big 3" would keep the lights on until the super-hero resurgence that became known as the Silver Age.
When it comes to back issues from this time period, as you might expect, they're getting older and tougher to find.  Action Comics #1 for example: it's estimated that only 50-100 copies of this book still exist and with that rarity comes value.  In 2011 a copy of Action Comics #1 in really nice condition sold for over $2 million dollars!  If you're looking to buy or collect back issues from this time period, just understand what a challenge it could be, especially in higher grades.</p>

<div class="div6"><div id="borderDemo"><p><strong>Comic Shop is the first book to trace the history of these cultural icons. Dan Gearino brings us from their origins to the present-day, when the rise of digital platforms and a changing retail landscape have the industry at a crossroads. When the book was first published in 2017, Gearino had spent a year with stores around the country, following how they navigated the business. For this updated and expanded paperback edition, he covers the wild retail landscape of 2017 and 2018, a time that was brutal for stores and rich for comics as an art form.</strong> </p></div> </div>
